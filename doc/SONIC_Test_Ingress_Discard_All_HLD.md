#### Overview
The purpose is to test "ingress_discard_all" counter triggers on receiving specific packets.
The "ingress_discard_all" counter counts all discard events. This counter counts concurrently with other discard counters.
The test assumes all necessary configuration are already pre-configured on the SONIC switch before test runs.
Destination IP address of the injected packet must be routable to ensure packet should be routed but was dropped.

#### Scope
The purpose of the test is testing of "ingress_discard_all" counter triggering on SONIC system, making sure that specific traffic drops correctly, according to sent packet and configured packet discards.
Supported topologies:
```
t0
t1
t1-lag
ptf32
```

#### Related DUT CLI commands
Command to check "ingress_discard_all" counter value:
```show interfaces counters```

Check field:
```RX_DRP```

#### General test flow
Inject packet into tor port. Set specifc MAC or IP addresses to BGP route learned on spine ports. Check "ingress_discard_all" counter incremented. Check the packet was dropped on spine port.

#### Run test
```
py.test --inventory ../ansible/inventory --host-pattern [DEVICE] --module-path ../ansible/library/ --testbed [DEVICE-TOPO] --testbed_file ../ansible/testbed.csv --junit-xml=./target/test-reports/ --show-capture=no --log-cli-level debug -ra -vvvvv ingress_discard/test_ingress_discard.py
```

#### Test cases
Each test case will be additionally validated by the loganalyzer utility.

Each test case will run specific traffic to trigger specific discard reasone.

Pytest fixture - "ptfadapter" is used to construct and send packets.

After packet is sent using source port index, test framework waits for specific packet did not appear, due to ingress packet drop, on one of the destination port indices.
